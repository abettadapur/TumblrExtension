## Tumblr Firefox Add-on
# Reblog from Source
Can be used on the Dashboard, Likes folder, and Queue. This add-on creates a “Reblog from Source” button that acts like a normal reblog, except it will reblog the post from the original post source, with the original comments, and nothing in between. This does not work on an individual user’s tumblelog.

###Good for

* Removing self-promos from the not-source
* Removing conversations on posts
* Removing unnecessary comments (“THIS^^^^^^^”, “THIS BELONGS ON EVERYONE’S BLOG”, “OMG TAG YOUR PORN!!!!”, “This is the money cat…”, “@usernameYouDon’tKnow”, etc)
* Sourcing the author and **encouraging artists on Tumblr**
* Ensuring you have the author’s comments and not someone’s who hijacked the post
* Shortening (by removing) the comment thread

###Current bugs

* Does not check for existing reblog-from-source buttons and will generate duplicates.

###Future goals

* Develop a better way to handle infinite-scroll pagination. (Currently handled, but not very gracefully.)
* Come up with an icon
* To open the ‘reblog from source’ panel on the Dashboard without losing your current place on the Dashboard. (Currently opens in another page and restarts the Dashboard, much like Tumblr’s reblog feature circa-2012.)
