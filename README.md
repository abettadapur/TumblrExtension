## Tumblr Firefox Add-on
# Reblog from Source
Can be used on the Dashboard, Likes folder, and Queue. This add-on creates a “Reblog from Source” button that acts like a normal reblog, except it will reblog the post from the original post source, with the original comments, and nothing in between. This does not work on an individual user’s tumblelog.

#Install Directions
[Install here] (https://github.com/abettadapur/TumblrExtension/blob/master/reblog_from_source-0.0.1-fx+an.xpi?raw=true)

1. On the link above, right click “save link as”.
2. Save the resulting .xpi file somewhere you can find.  This is the add-on file.
3. Open your Firefox window and then drag this .xpi file into the browser window.
4. Firefox should then pop-up a window asking to install the add-on.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions from there to install the add-on.
6. Open Tumblr.com and the add-on should be installed and working.

###Good for

* Sourcing the author and **encouraging artists on Tumblr**
* Removing self-promos from the not-source
* Removing conversations on posts
* Removing unnecessary comments (“THIS^^^^^^^”, “THIS BELONGS ON EVERYONE’S BLOG”, “OMG TAG YOUR PORN!!!!”, “This is the money cat…”, “@usernameYouDon’tKnow”, etc)
* Ensuring you have the author’s comments and not someone’s who hijacked the post
* Shortening (by removing) the comment thread

###Current bugs
* Occasionally loads the reblog page but not the reblog modal. Best solved by closing said reblog window and waiting for initial page to load in its entirety. 

###Future goals

* Develop for Chrome
* Develop a better way to handle infinite-scroll pagination. (Currently handled, but not very gracefully.)
* To open the ‘reblog from source’ panel on the Dashboard without losing your current place on the Dashboard. (Currently opens in another page and restarts the Dashboard, much like Tumblr’s reblog feature circa-2012.)
